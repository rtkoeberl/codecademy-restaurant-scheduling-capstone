# Expresso: A Codecademy Project

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, you will build all of the routing and database logic for an internal tool for a coffee shop called Expresso.

The Expresso internal tool should allow users to:
- Create, view, update, and delete menus
- Create, view, update, and delete menu items
- Create, view, update, and delete employees
- Create, view, update, and delete employee's timesheets

## My Process

I'll be deleting steps from this ReadMe as I complete them, so any future listed instructions represent work yet to be done on the project.
